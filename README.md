# Aurora's Bar
>...is a little place on the beautiful Ambergis Caye west of Belize mainland.
While on vacation, we visited their littel bar on the Caribbean Ocean and took
a liking to Aurora, Evan, and their little bit of paradise. When in Belize, definitely
look them up. This website started to take shape right then and there. It is static 
website that uses simple html, css, and javaScript files.

## This project includes:
    -some simple javaScript animation;
    -some fairly in-depth styling that uses transitions in conjunction with the script;
    -some design elements modeled after the existing business menu;
